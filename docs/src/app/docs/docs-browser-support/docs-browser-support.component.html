<h1>Browser Support</h1>

<app-carbon-ad></app-carbon-ad>

<p>
  Blueprint CSS has full support in all major browser vendors as well as ie10+.
</p>

<p>
  Partial IE8 and IE9 support can be acheived by adding the
  <a href="https://github.com/coryrylan/blueprint-css/tree/master/dist"
    target="_blank">polyfill</a> JavaScript. The polyfill includes
  <a href="" target="_blank"></a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/10up/flexibility" target="_blank">Flexibility</a> to add Flexbox support to IE8 and IE9 as well as
  <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" target="_blank">Respond</a> for media queries in IE8. Note certain flexbox alignments are not supported by the grid or the Flexibility
  but general layout with the grid should work. For ie9 and ie8 support you must specify a column breakpoint ex:
  <code>@sm, @md, @lg</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Warning</strong> if you have a significantly large user base on IE9 or below. Adding these polyfills will require your
  users to have good JavaScript support. Also this will slow down the rendering speed for these users. Take this into consideration
  when using these polyfills.
